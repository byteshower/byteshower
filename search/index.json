        "title": "How sea otters can fight climate change",
        "body": "Sea otters were hunted to the brink in the 19th Century fur trade, but their numbers have been slowly recovering since. The return of these playful creatures doesn\u0026rsquo;t just transform their ecosystems, it can turn them into a powerful carbon sink.\nSea otters are creatures steeped in superlatives.\nEnhydra lutris is the furriest animal on Earth, with up to 140,000 hairs on every square centimeter of its body – meaning its hairs are 700 times as dense as those on a human head. Unlike many other marine mammals, they lack blubber, so they keep themselves warm by eating a quarter of their body weight in food a day. Sea otters also play a singular role in supporting kelp forests ecosystems in the North Pacific.\nFew other animals eat as much relative to their weight or play such a pivotal role in maintaining their environment, says Brent Hughes, a marine ecologist studying coastal habitats at Sonoma State University in California.\nNow, scientists are studying how these marine mustelids may also be climate superheroes. Sea otters help ecosystems capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it as biomass and deep-sea detritus, preventing it from being converted back to carbon dioxide and contributing to climate change.\nSea otters were once widespread across coastal waters in the Northern Pacific Ocean, from Baja California to Alaska, all the way to rocky reefs in Russia and Japan. However, in the 1700s and 1800s, fur traders hunted their population down to about 2,000 animals. Since then, conservation efforts have allowed the otters to rebound somewhat, but some 2,500 miles (4,000km) of coastline in their historic range is still devoid of the furry mammals.\nThis loss of otters demonstrated their indispensable role in kelp forests. While diving in Alaska\u0026rsquo;s Aleutian Islands in the 1970s, James Estes, a marine ecologist with the University of California, Santa Cruz, documented that kelp forests without sea otters essentially become underwater deserts. In contrast, in areas with otters, the kelp flourished – along with the diverse aquatic community that feeds and shelters among the seaweed. \u0026ldquo;Just in my own soul, it was an important thing,\u0026rdquo; he says of his early observations of that stark difference. \u0026ldquo;I felt like I had learned something that was fairly remarkable.\u0026rdquo;\nThese perpetually hungry mammals don\u0026rsquo;t only protect kelp ecosystems. Sea otters can also benefit seagrass The key to that difference has to do with sea otters\u0026rsquo; voracious appetites. In order to maintain their high metabolic rates, the mammals must eat constantly. Among their favorite foods are sea urchins, which are easy to catch and dense in calories. When present, sea otters eat so many urchins that the invertebrate\u0026rsquo;s population stays low. \u0026ldquo;They have a disproportionately large impact on the ecosystem relative to their abundance,\u0026rdquo; says Heidi Pearson, a marine biologist at the University of Alaska Southeast. This is what makes them a \u0026ldquo;keystone\u0026rdquo; species – without their presence, the stability of the entire ecosystem can be lost.\nSea otters have voracious appetites, eating about a quarter of their body weight every day (Credit: Getty Images) Sea otters have voracious appetites, eating about a quarter of their body weight every day (Credit: Getty Images)\nWhen sea otters are lost from an ecosystem, sea urchin numbers spike. The herbivorous urchins then basically clear cut the kelp, chewing through the holdfasts at their base and sending the rest of the giant algae to wash away. Along with it goes the habitat for numerous species, including fish, invertebrates and other mammals.\nSea urchins even stick around after slashing through kelp beds. They enter a dormant state, biding their time under new kelp sprouts, and then revving back into action to eat the young seaweed. These invertebrates have become known as \u0026ldquo;zombie urchins\u0026rdquo; for this ability. If sea otters return, however, their feasting can put the herbivores in check and allow the kelp to flourish once again.\nEven before the sea otter effect was studied, kelp has been thought of as a possible climate solution. That\u0026rsquo;s because it can grow really fast – up to 60cm (24 inches) a day But these perpetually hungry mammals don\u0026rsquo;t only protect kelp ecosystems. Sea otters can also benefit seagrass. In these zones, otters mostly feed on crabs. When the mustelids bring down the numbers of crabs, grazing organisms that the crabs eat rebound. These slugs and snails often don\u0026rsquo;t eat the seagrass; instead they scrape away the algae that grows on the grass, which allows the seagrass to absorb more sunlight and grow more efficiently. \u0026ldquo;They miraculously don\u0026rsquo;t eat the seagrass,\u0026rdquo; says Hughes. \u0026ldquo;They have this little radula that gently scrapes [the seagrass] and takes off all the epiphytes growing on it. And so it essentially protects the seagrass.\u0026rdquo;\nIn California\u0026rsquo;s Elkhorn Slough estuary, eelgrass had nearly disappeared by the early 1980s due to declining water quality – nutrient pollution from farms increased algal growth, smothering the seagrass. But since the return of the otters, the eelgrass has expanded by more than sixfold.\nAnd in both these ecosystems, otters might have the added benefit of storing carbon.\nIn 2012, a team of ecologists including Estes published a study on the potential for sea otter carbon sequestration in the North Pacific between the Aleutian archipelago and Vancouver Island. Using data on the rate of kelp growth and its density at sites with and without otters, they found that the presence of sea otters across rocky reef habitat in the study area, covering 51,551 square kilometers (19,900 square miles – an area about the same size as Costa Rica), is capable of storing 4.4 to 8.7 million tonnes of carbon compared to if an otter-free condition. That\u0026rsquo;s more carbon than that emitted from a million passenger cars for a year.\nIn areas where sea otter populations thrive, kelp forests often flourish too – growing at a rate of up to 60cm (24 inches) a day (Credit: Getty Images) In areas where sea otter populations thrive, kelp forests often flourish too – growing at a rate of up to 60cm (24 inches) a day (Credit: Getty Images)\nEven before the sea otter effect was studied, kelp has been thought of as a possible climate solution. That\u0026rsquo;s because it can grow really fast – up to 60cm (24 inches) a day. That means it\u0026rsquo;s pulling carbon from the atmosphere faster than a slower growing plant (though kelp is technically an alga). When kelp dies and washes ashore, carbon returns to the atmosphere during decomposition. But when dead kelp sinks to the sea floor, it might not surface (and therefore decompose and produce carbon dioxide) for thousands of years. \u0026ldquo;A kelp frond that drifts to the seafloor and decomposes, that carbon might be trapped in the sediments for millennia, even millions of years,\u0026rdquo; says Pearson.\nCarbon that is thus sequestered – prevented from entering the atmosphere for 100 or more years – can be key to addressing the climate crisis. But how much carbon from kelp is sequestered is still unknown. Part of the trouble is the gas-filled sacks along their stalks. When kelp dies, it tends to stay buoyant until those little floats break down. \u0026ldquo;When those kelps get dislodged they can travel and circulate on the surface for a 1,000km [620 miles],\u0026rdquo; says Hughes.\nIn addition to kelp forests, otters\u0026rsquo; effect on seagrasses may also benefit the climate. Like kelp, seagrass absorbs carbon as it grows, and stores much of that carbon in its roots. And when older roots die, the carbon becomes locked in the sediments, where it can take hundreds of years or more to convert back to its gaseous form. \u0026ldquo;When I think about marine plants that can sequester carbon really well, it\u0026rsquo;s typically the rooted ones,\u0026rdquo; says Hughes. \u0026ldquo;So I\u0026rsquo;m talking sea grasses, marshes and mangroves – those are going to be the big three carbon sequestration habitats, in my opinion.\u0026rdquo;\nEven at a lower estimate, sea otter carbon sequestration can add up. If only 1% of kelp between the Aleutians and Vancouver Island is stowed away in the deep sea, that\u0026rsquo;s still enough to offset the emissions of 100,000 combustion-powered automobiles. And if otters continue to rebound across their historic range, that would increase this carbon store – and all the ecosystem benefits of otters. \u0026ldquo;When we help restore missing keystone predators, we make things right in a lot of ways before we even recognise what some of those ways are,\u0026rdquo; Lilian Carswell, the southern sea otter recovery coordinator for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, wrote in an email to the BBC.\nBut reintroducing otters is not a win for everyone. Their massive appetites can diminish fishing opportunities for commercial operations and subsistence-based Indigenous communities.\nQuantifying the effect of otters might help ease some of the impacts to fisheries. Based on the December 2012 price on the European Carbon Exchange ($47 [£36] per tonne of carbon), Estes\u0026rsquo; paper that year estimated that sea otter presence in their North Pacific study area was worth up to $408m (£296m). Carbon prices have climbed since then, recently exceeding €60 (£51/$71) a tonne, which would bring that estimate even higher in today\u0026rsquo;s market. And a 2020 study found that the monetary benefit of sea otters – due their restoration of kelp habitat and associated increase in fish stocks, carbon sequestration, and ecotourism value – outweighs the losses to shellfish fisheries.\nPerhaps win-win strategies for bringing back this keystone species exist. One idea researchers have floated is to use money from otter-generated carbon offsets to compensate fishers for losses in their catch. If the value of otter carbon banking is recognised by our human banks, maybe the mustelids will soon swim across more reefs and estuaries – fighting climate change while they\u0026rsquo;re at it.\n"

        "body": "A resurgence in pastoralism, one of the world\u0026rsquo;s more sustainable food systems, could help Spain adapt to climate change and revitalise depopulated rural areas.\nAAs late May approached, the animals were growing restless. In little more than a day, the heat from the southerly desert winds had turned the grass dry, leaving Jesús Garzón\u0026rsquo;s herd of 1,100 sheep and goats little to eat. Garzón knew – and the animals, nervous and bleating, knew as well – it was time to head north, where cool weather and fresh pastures awaited them.\nAhead lay an over 400km (250-mile) journey by foot across the Iberian Peninsula through heat, cold, wind and rain. Out of the winter lowlands west of Madrid, past crops of barley and wheat, through holm oak meadows speckled with juniper and rosemary, to forests of scots pines, where imperial eagles nest and black vultures breed. Continuing north through villages and cities into the territory of roe deer, wild boar and wolves, ascending plateaus and descending river valleys until, a month later, they would arrive at their summer destination: the mountain pastures in the Picos de Europa.\nEvery spring and autumn, Garzón and his herd make this seasonal migration, called transhumance – from the Latin trans for \u0026ldquo;across\u0026rdquo; and humus for \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo; – a form of pastoralism where animals typically move to and from summer highlands and winter lowlands to take advantage of seasonal peaks in pastures and avoid extreme temperatures.\nAfter being abandoned for half a century, the recovery of transhumance in Spain demonstrates how pastoralism, a livelihood suited to coping with uncertainty and sustainable food systems, can help preserve biodiversity, while breathing life into depopulated rural areas.\nPracticed by 200 to 500 million people across the world\u0026rsquo;s rangelands – grasslands, savannahs, mountain pastures, tundra and steppe covering half the earth\u0026rsquo;s land surface – pastoralism is significant socially, environmentally and economically. Yet misconceptions and an underappreciation of its benefits means it has been largely overlooked in international sustainability discussions and agendas.\nAs a herder who has also been at the forefront of efforts to revive this ancient practice and raise awareness of its importance, Garzón understands its potential, and its challenges, well.\nTranshumant herds pass winters in lowlands where pasture and water are plentiful (Credit: TyN) Transhumant herds pass winters in lowlands where pasture and water are plentiful (Credit: TyN)\nAfter thriving for hundreds of years, in the 20th Century modernity caught up with transhumance in Spain. Rail and eventually truck transport took its place, while many herders intensified production and settled. Long-distance transhumance up to 700km (435 miles) ceased to exist and the network of drove roads fell into disuse. For decades, only short journeys – transterminance – continued.\nThe end of transhumance in Spain had severe ecological impacts. Abandoned mountain pastures experienced biodiversity loss and heightened wildfire risk; lowlands suffered overgrazing and trees stopped regenerating.\nIt was the lack of new trees that brought Garzón, who previously worked in conservation, to transhumance. It was a turning point for him. At the time, he recalls, re-establishing transhumance was considered \u0026ldquo;totally impossible\u0026rdquo;, but he persevered and in 1993 assisted Spain\u0026rsquo;s first transhumance in more than half a century. Shortly after, Garzón founded the Association for Transhumance and Nature (TyN), which supports transhumant herders who face legal or logistical obstacles.\nFrom the start, Garzón\u0026rsquo;s objective was to recover Spain\u0026rsquo;s drove roads, etched over centuries into the land, measuring 125,000km (78,000 miles) in length. Although pastoralism is practised in 75% of countries, Spain is the only country worldwide with a network of legally protected drove roads for the movement of herds. But Garzón\u0026rsquo;s vision for transhumance extends well beyond the country\u0026rsquo;s borders. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re trying to transfer the Spanish example of a network of livestock trails, that herders can use freely, to the rest of the world,\u0026rdquo; says Garzón.\nHerds typically cover distances of 20km (12 miles) every day during the spring and autumn transhumance (Credit: TyN) Herds typically cover distances of 20km (12 miles) every day during the spring and autumn transhumance (Credit: TyN)\nLeaving the lowland pastures west of Madrid behind, the high-rises of the city came into sight. But the state of the drove road Garzón travelled by deteriorated as it approached the city. In the years since herds had used it, cars and motorcycles had degraded the grassland and eroded the soil. With little pasture and water for the animals, it was not a place Garzón would normally linger in. The herd was here, however, with a specific mission: to help restore drove roads in the vicinity of Spain\u0026rsquo;s capital.\nWhile camping equipment, portable electric fences to corral animals overnight and vehicles to ferry supplies have made transhumance somewhat more comfortable, the journey remains difficult. Highways, crops and private land frequently encroach the roads. Finding places to overnight is tricky, and what shelters exist are often in disrepair, lacking water and sanitation facilities. Water sources for animals are few and far between, or broken; and herding hundreds or thousands of animals across highways requires coordination from authorities.\nThe poor state of the drove roads is a major obstacle challenging the viability of transhumance and preventing further revival. \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to get from point A to point B, no matter how much you want to do it, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to do it,\u0026rdquo; says Maria Fernandez-Gimenez, professor of rangeland ecology and management at Colorado State University.\nRecognising this, the Life Cañadas project was launched to recover the ecological role of drove roads in Madrid and the region of Castile-La Mancha, improve connectivity between landscapes and help herders with problems they face. With the collaboration of herders like Garzón, herds are being reintroduced to facilitate restoration.\nDrove roads function as ecological corridors and provide a refuge for plants and animals, says Francisco Azcárate, project coordinator and professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid. As herds migrate, mimicking the role of natural grazers, they disperse seeds, connecting habitats and preserving biodiversity. In Spain, each sheep transports 5,000 seeds and fertilises the land with 3kg of manure daily. \u0026ldquo;In Europe, nature needs herbivores that don\u0026rsquo;t exist nowadays [and] a way of grazing the landscape that is very similar to what transhumance does,\u0026rdquo; Azcárate says. \u0026ldquo;You need to work with livestock, move the animals and plan on a seasonal basis the management of territory.\u0026rdquo;\nThe project will also repair water points and shelters. \u0026ldquo;We have hope that if we can solve some of these main problems, people will continue to do the transhumance, or other[s] can join in the future,\u0026rdquo; says Azcárate.\nTo monitor changes, the team will measure soil properties, conduct biodiversity surveys of flora and fauna and sample grassland communities in experimental and control plots. To Azcárate\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, this is the first project in Spain to attempt to physically restore drove roads.\nDrove roads around the country are in bad condition after decades of abandonment, encroachment and inappropriate vehicle use (Credit: Life Cañadas) Drove roads around the country are in bad condition after decades of abandonment, encroachment and inappropriate vehicle use (Credit: Life Cañadas)\nThrough grazing, pastoralism provides further benefits to the ecosystem. So long as a threshold of overgrazing is not crossed – which seasonal migration helps avoid – grazing stimulates plant growth, increases productivity, reduces soil erosion and facilitates water retention.\nGrazing also helps reduce wildfire risk and lessen the intensity of fires that do break out, says Elisa Oteros-Rozas, a researcher at the Open University of Catalonia. \u0026ldquo;When pastoralism disappears, biomass accumulates,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;And that makes ecosystems more vulnerable to large-scale wildfires.\u0026rdquo; In areas prone to wildfires, like the Mediterranean, grazing could be a cost-effective prevention method – especially as more and bigger wildfires are predicted due to climate change.\nMore recently, grazing is being touted as a solution to climate change. However, the extent to which grazing contributes to climate mitigation is the subject of much debate. Some researchers argue grazing has significant potential to increase long-term carbon storage. Estimates of how much sequestration is possible vary widely. One study by the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation suggests improved grazing management of the world\u0026rsquo;s grasslands could sequester 409 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year – equating to 1.1% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions.\nOther research argues ambitious climate mitigation claims about grazing are wrong. A 2017 report by the Food Climate Research Network writes that while better grazing management is worthwhile for reasons like soil health, biodiversity and erosion control, overall, it is not a significant solution for climate change. The report suggests grazing management offsets between 20-60% of annual average emissions from the grazing sector, which accounts for only a small fraction of all livestock, making an insignificant dent on total livestock emissions. The same report also suggests that the carbon benefits of grazing management will diminish over time, as the soil becomes less efficient at sequestering carbon.\nUnlike industrial farming, which relies on fossil fuels, chemical inputs and fodder, pastoralism only relies on seasonally available pastures. \u0026ldquo;Grazing animals make use of the resources that are not good for cropping and for agriculture, and turn them into food we as humans can digest and can eat,\u0026rdquo; says Oteros-Rozas.\nPasture-fed animal products have better nutritional profiles, too. Feeding on natural biodiverse pastures produces meat, milk and cheeses that contain more nutrients and healthy fats. The combination of minimal external inputs and high-quality food make pastoralism one of the most sustainable food production systems.\nWhile many benefits of pastoralism are enjoyed by wider society, it has particular potential to bring vitality to rural areas that have long suffered from neglect. \u0026ldquo;Pastoralism helps to create employment in rural areas and fights against rural depopulation, and maintains culture and a valuable gastronomy,\u0026rdquo; says Celsa Peiteado Morales, agricultural policy and rural development coordinator at WWF Spain.\nMany of the ancient drove roads criss-crossing Spain pass through villages and city centres, including the capital of Madrid (Credit: David Rubio) Many of the ancient drove roads criss-crossing Spain pass through villages and city centres, including the capital of Madrid (Credit: David Rubio)\nA lack of official data makes it difficult to know the state of transhumance in Spain. By the end of the 20th Century, the number of transhumant sheep was estimated at 1.3 million. The last survey, from 2011, recorded 270,000 transhumant sheep, only 10% of which moved between pastures by foot. Garzón estimates there are currently 600,000 transhumant livestock – sheep, cows and some goats – and 6,000 transhumant families, 20% of whom move by foot.\nFor Garzón, transhumance is undoubtedly gaining momentum as climate change creates more challenging conditions – droughts, rising fodder prices – for sedentary livestock in southern Spain.\nResearch suggests a revival has occurred in some corners of Spain. In the Aragonese Pyrenees, for example, Fernandez-Gimenez found several families have resumed transhumance over the past decade after abandoning it due to difficult living and working conditions. For herders, the increased availability of low-cost winter grazing lands made transhumance more profitable than sedentary livestock, but access to inexpensive, high-quality summer pastures, as well as technology, which helps families cope with time apart, were crucial, too. \u0026ldquo;There are many ecological, animal health and lifestyle benefits to being a transhumant. But bottom line, it\u0026rsquo;s more profitable and that\u0026rsquo;s why people are going back,\u0026rdquo; says Fernandez-Gimenez.\nPeople without experience in transhumance who are looking for a new way of life are also helping revive it. Since the 2000s, shepherd schools have popped up across Spain, teaching new generations the ins and outs of herding and helping to reverse low rates of younger generations taking up transhumance.\nJesús Garzón and the herd of the Mesta Council pass summers in mountain pastures of the Picos of Europe, where pastures are plentiful and weather is mild.

(Credit: TyN)\nElsewhere in Spain, restoring drove roads could help more herders resume transhumance by foot – particularly in Castile and León, a major transhumance waypoint and destination. According to Garzón, the region has not complied with the 1995 Livestock Trail Act that protects, preserves and promotes the drove roads. Because of their condition, herders are hesitant to use them. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m concerned that…in almost 30 years of the law, practically nothing has been done – no signaling, no demarcation, no improvement of the livestock trails,\u0026rdquo; he adds.\nDifferentiating extensive grazing – when livestock are raised on natural pastures – from industrial farming is also key, says Peiteado. Without this distinction, \u0026ldquo;policies cannot be properly oriented in support of pastoralism,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;This characterisation and differentiation…is the first step that has to be taken to guarantee the future of pastoralism in Spain.\u0026rdquo;\nOn one hand, says Peiteado, this would allow tools such as public funds from the European Union\u0026rsquo;s Common Agricultural Policy to ensure the socioeconomic viability of extensive grazing. On the other hand, differentiation would allow consumers to support pastoralism. \u0026ldquo;The problem we have in Spain…is that when we go to buy a product in the market, as consumers we can\u0026rsquo;t differentiate,\u0026rdquo; says Peiteado. \u0026ldquo;There should be clear labeling that allows us to see what comes from extensive livestock farming and what comes from industrial livestock farming, so that knowing the impacts of one model and the benefits of the other, we can choose.\u0026rdquo;\nOteros-Rozas agrees that acknowledging the true value of the product is critical. \u0026ldquo;Shepherds say they want the product to be valued, and priced according to the value…the main point is to stop subsidising industrial farming and imports of meat and dairy products from other countries…that compete in an unfair way with our local pastoral systems,\u0026rdquo; she says.\nAdvocates of pastoralism are hopeful it will continue carving out a place for itself in a world that has changed profoundly since the first transhumant herders began their journey.\n\u0026ldquo;Pastoralism is this way of life attuned to making efficient use of the available resources and adapting to what\u0026rsquo;s there in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm the system and often enhances it,\u0026rdquo; says Fernandez-Gimenez. \u0026ldquo;Rather than trying to get rid of it, we need to learn from it, because those lessons are going to be ever more important under a changing climate and changing environment.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the mountain pastures of the Picos de Europa, Garzón and the herd pass the summer in ease, waking to crisp mornings and occasional showers while the rest of the country swelters through record-breaking heat. There they will remain until the first snowfall, signalling the time to retrace their steps south has arrived.\n\u0026ldquo;The planet is facing a situation of real social and economic catastrophe,\u0026rdquo; says Garzón. \u0026ldquo;But pastoralism is going to survive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash;\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

        "body": "Thanks to a grassroots scheme, you can now reach a large number of remote tourist spots around the Costa Rican town of Monteverde in an electric vehicle.\nOn the road to Monteverde, Costa Rica, a mountain town nestled in an otherworldly cloud forest, the restaurant El Sol sits on a cliff\u0026rsquo;s edge, the last stop before a steep, uphill drive of misty vistas and hairpin turns. It looks like a traditional soda, a roadside restaurant serving casados (rice next to beans), mashed plantains, and fresh juices. Except it also has a silver cylinder with green lettering in the parking lot, the area\u0026rsquo;s first electric vehicle (EV) charging station.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like smart phones,\u0026rdquo; says Minor Oliverio, El Sol\u0026rsquo;s owner. \u0026ldquo;Eventually everyone will have electric chargers and vehicles. But someone has to be first.\u0026rdquo;\nThe station is part of Monteverde\u0026rsquo;s Ruta Eléctrica, Latin America\u0026rsquo;s only grassroots charging network created to head off \u0026ldquo;range anxiety\u0026rdquo; – the worry that a vehicle won\u0026rsquo;t have enough charge to reach its destination – and develop electric-vehicle-friendly communities outside of cities.\nPre-pandemic, Monteverde received over 200,000 visitors annually; most of them in large SUVs, often clogging its small commercial center with fumes. To compensate, climate activists and business owners decided to create a charging network to promote electric vehicle tourism, installing its first plug points in 2019.\nThe majestic cloud forests of Monteverde are a well-known tourist attraction, but until now travellers have had few green options to reach the region (Credit: Getty Images) The majestic cloud forests of Monteverde are a well-known tourist attraction, but until now travellers have had few green options to reach the region (Credit: Getty Images)\nA lack of infrastructure is one of the primary challenges to electrifying Latin America\u0026rsquo;s transport sector. Most charging networks in the region are established through state-sponsored systems or large charging companies that are generally conglomerated in cities. In contrast, Ruta Eléctrica is jumpstarting this process in remote towns through deceptively low-tech solutions: reserved parking spots, clear signage, online maps, and accessible, well-maintained plug points.\nYou might also like:\nThe ancient Persian way to keep cool The new use for old coal mines The force redrawing India\u0026rsquo;s coast \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not waiting for the government to install chargers,\u0026rdquo; says Katy Van Dusen, a longtime Monteverde resident and founder of the Monteverde Commission for Resilience to Climate Change (Corclima), a resiliency organisation of which Ruta Eléctrica is one initiative. \u0026ldquo;Businesses can offer charging infrastructure anywhere there\u0026rsquo;s electricity. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of making it available to electric vehicles.\u0026rdquo;\nA sustainable solution\nCosta Rica has installed close to 200 semi-rapid and rapid charging stations, but the majority of them are in and around San Jose. Another roughly 85 charging points, most of them simple 120v plug points, called L1 stations, have grown out of Ruta Eléctrica.\nWhile installing fast charging stations is prohibitively expensive for most rural businesses, Van Dusen and her team engage hotel and restaurant owners, coffee shops, tour operators and nature reserves to offer free charging for clients. While waiting for their vehicles to charge, visitors can eat, sleep, shop or hike. Van Dusen calls this \u0026ldquo;charging with a purpose\u0026rdquo;.\nRuta Eléctrica sprang up remarkably quickly when a community organisation set to work to make the region a leader in sustainable transport (Credit: José Pablo Porras) Ruta Eléctrica sprang up remarkably quickly when a community organisation set to work to make the region a leader in sustainable transport (Credit: José Pablo Porras)\nAs the pandemic upended tourism, businesses saw an opportunity to attract new clients and double down on sustainability through Ruta Eléctrica. At Hotel Belmar, offering free charging has attracted electric vehicle drivers. \u0026ldquo;In rural areas like Monteverde, people are actually more environmentally conscious,\u0026rdquo; says Richard Garro, the hotel\u0026rsquo;s sustainability manager. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s part of why people come here.\u0026rdquo;\nConverting all 120v plugs to 240v or L2 stations would cut charging time by more than 50% for most cars and is a major goal for the network. But even the fastest chargers – high voltage L3 stations that only electric utilities have the resources and knowledge to install – can take 30 minutes to an hour to fully charge a vehicle. Community leaders see that time as an opportunity to support local businesses.\n\u0026ldquo;We want businesses to spend as little as possible [on charging up people\u0026rsquo;s vehicles],\u0026rdquo; says Daniel Castillo, a technical advisor for Ruta Eléctrica and founder of Energías Limpias de Costa Rica (Elco) a Costa Rican charging company. Castillo is now focused on selling portable chargers to car dealers to include with electric vehicle sales. \u0026ldquo;All a local business has to do is install plug points.\u0026rdquo;\nSince most of Ruta Eléctrica\u0026rsquo;s network is to support travellers, pushing rental car companies to offer electric vehicles is critical. Only a handful of companies currently include electric cars as part of their fleet. While uncertainty around the resale of used electric vehicles is one barrier, lack of charging infrastructure in tourist destinations outside of cities is another.\nMilena Ramirez, the current coordinator of Ruta Eléctrica Monteverde and the town\u0026rsquo;s tourism board director, recently borrowed Van Dusen\u0026rsquo;s electric car to visit all of Monteverde\u0026rsquo;s charging points to ensure functionality. \u0026ldquo;It was my first time driving a long distance in an electric vehicle, and I was nervous about range,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;You need more communities to build [charging] corridors. It\u0026rsquo;s not about one business offering this service. We all benefit when many businesses are involved.\u0026rdquo;\nA pioneering project\nIn many sectors, Costa Rica is already punching above its weight in the global climate crisis fight. In addition to its ambitious decarbonisation plan, nearly 100% of its electricity is generated from renewable sources, deforestation was banned in 1996 and a moratorium on oil and gas production could become law later this year.\nCosta Rica\u0026rsquo;s transport sector remains a challenge for decarbonisation, with large numbers of inefficient vehicles using fossil fuels (Credit: Getty Images) Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s transport sector remains a challenge for decarbonisation, with large numbers of inefficient vehicles using fossil fuels (Credit: Getty Images)\nWithin this context, Monteverde plays a leading role in sustainability in the country. A blended community of Quakers and Costa Rican farmers, the town established the country\u0026rsquo;s largest private reserve, The Children\u0026rsquo;s Eternal Rainforest, which includes 230 sq km (89 sq miles) of protected land. The forest acts as a critical watershed for surrounding communities, farms and hydroelectric projects that produce over a third of Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s electricity.\n\u0026ldquo;Monteverde is a trailblazer. Sustainability tourism models for the country came from the work people were doing there,\u0026rdquo; says Monica Araya, an electric mobility advocate and cofounder of Asomove, Latin America\u0026rsquo;s first electric vehicle association. Araya witnessed the idea for Ruta Eléctrica develop during a talk she gave in Monteverde in 2017 about the community\u0026rsquo;s natural role as an electric mobility pioneer. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen people get organised so fast. By Monday, Corclima got started on a plan.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the town may be an outlier, Araya says the country\u0026rsquo;s sustainability ethos runs deep. \u0026ldquo;Our commitment to the natural world is part of our identity,\u0026rdquo; says Araya. \u0026ldquo;Instead of bashing ourselves for not being green in certain areas, we need to build on what we\u0026rsquo;ve done so far.\u0026rdquo;\nYet the transport sector is still a major sustainability challenge for Costa Rica, accounting for over half of the country\u0026rsquo;s carbon emissions. Like in many countries, cars are aspirational in Costa Rica, a symbol of progress. Car ownership is on the rise, and the traffic-logged central valley has the third highest vehicle density in Latin America, filled with used cars that left the assembly line an average of 16 years ago.\nInvestment in public transportation is a cornerstone of the country\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure plan, with a focus on an electric train network and high-speed buses. But First Lady Claudia Dobles says that a cultural shift will not happen through policy alone. She\u0026rsquo;s eager to see initiatives like Ruta Eléctrica grow, saying they pave the way for change. \u0026ldquo;Our work around sustainability comes from the community and rises up. Without citizen participation, there is no decarbonisation plan.\u0026rdquo;\nA growing network\nCorclima is now scaling the model into a national network, Rutas Electricas Costa Rica. It has already expanded to La Fortuna, an ecotourism hub to the north, and will launch in Nosara, a beach community on the Pacific. By the end of 2022, it hopes to reach 14 towns.\nA major impact of the effort has been educational. \u0026ldquo;The barrier to electric mobility in this country isn\u0026rsquo;t just the cost,\u0026rdquo; says Maria Jose Ventura, an electric mobility technical consultant. While the initial cash outlay is high, electric vehicles achieve price parity with combustible engine cars within 5-6 years and are cheaper over a 10-year period due to government incentives, fewer maintenance requirements and the low price of electricity relative to gas. \u0026ldquo;The bigger barrier, I think, is education,\u0026rdquo; says Ventura. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s where programs like Ruta Eléctrica are critical.\u0026rdquo;\nThe vast majority of Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s electricity comes from clean sources, such as hydropower (Credit: Getty Images) The vast majority of Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s electricity comes from clean sources, such as hydropower (Credit: Getty Images)\nIn a small town outside of Tamarindo, Douglas Anderson recently decided to join the network. As an electrician, he had been trying to convince local businesses to offer charging options. \u0026ldquo;When people see there are other communities behind this, they realise it\u0026rsquo;s not just me with futuristic ideas.\u0026rdquo;\nInformation sharing is a key benefit of Rutas Eléctricas. What\u0026rsquo;s been learned in Monteverde – the importance of installing 240 plug points, what kinds of adaptors are best, how to keep bugs out of plugs – is being shared with other communities. Corclima is developing a comprehensive member handbook as well as a registry for businesses to track usage.\n\u0026ldquo;Most business owners came on board as an opportunity to attract new customers,\u0026rdquo; says Luis Perez, the first Ruta Eléctrica coordinator in Monteverde who now works with an adventure tourism company. \u0026ldquo;They aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily interested in networking and connecting. But the other 20% have become advocates and they are spreading the idea.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Fortuna, businesses are showing renewed interest in joining the network as tourism returns. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s really changing is that everyone, from the security guard to the receptionist, now knows about electric vehicles. They see the signs and chargers, and they\u0026rsquo;re starting to see EV cars,\u0026rdquo; says Adriana Comacho, the Ruta Eléctrica Fortuna coordinator and an environmental manager at Tabacón, a hot springs spa and hotel.\nWhile electric vehicles are a small fraction of the 1.4 million cars on Costa Rican roads, numbers are projected to increase exponentially by 2023. This may lead to challenges ahead, such as how businesses can recoup the cost of electricity. Since electricity is nationalised, only government utilities are authorised to sell it. Corclima has designed a tool that calculates how much specific cars cost to charge hoping it will help small businesses track electricity expenditures as electric vehicles scale.\nBut for now, most business owners aren\u0026rsquo;t worried about electricity costs. Johnny Calderon, the owner of Flow Trips, a tour company in La Fortuna, had his first visit from an electric vehicle user this month. He and his wife began clapping and taking photos. Though the driver didn\u0026rsquo;t buy a tour, Calderon\u0026rsquo;s whole family gathered around the car to watch it charge. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care if it takes time to get EV clients. I want to be part of the change. Maybe some day it will have an economic benefit but that\u0026rsquo;s not why I\u0026rsquo;m doing it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash;\nTo report this story BBC Future travelled 60 miles (97km) by electric vehicle, for which we have no precise CO2 emission estimates.

        "title": "The far-reaching benefits of tiger sharks for climate",
        "body": "Worldwide, shark populations are on the decline. Boosting their numbers could have a cascade effect to help sink carbon and make the oceans more resilient to climate change.\nOn the westernmost tip of Australia in the aptly named Shark Bay, at least 28 species of shark swim through the clear waters and undulating seagrass meadows – the largest in the world. Tiger sharks in particular are common frequenters of the jagged inlets of Shark Bay. These mammoth predatory fish brush their 15-ft-long (4.5m) bodies through the seagrass, occasionally snatching a majestic grazing sea cow for a meal. While the presence of tiger sharks is a threat to their prey, these predators are crucial to the health of the marine ecosystem that supports both species.\nIn fact, despite sharks\u0026rsquo; notorious reputation among humans, they could also be a powerful ally in curbing climate change.\nIt all comes back to the wispy strands of seagrass that sway with the waves in the shallows of Shark Bay. This seagrass is food for the sea cows, or dugongs, who each graze on roughly 40kg (88lb) of seagrass a day – as well as for manatees and green sea turtles.\nOff Australia\u0026rsquo;s north-east coast of Queensland, tiger sharks are estimated to have fallen by at least 71% Dugongs, which can weigh as much as 500kg (1,100lb), are a rich source of food for tiger sharks. By keeping the sea cow population in check, tiger sharks in Shark Bay help the seagrass meadows thrive. A flourishing seagrass meadow stores twice as much CO2 per square mile as forests typically do on land.\nShark Bay experienced an intense heatwave in 2011, causing waters to rise by up to 5C for two months (Credit: Getty Images) Shark Bay experienced an intense heatwave in 2011, causing waters to rise by up to 5C for two months (Credit: Getty Images)\nBut globally, tiger shark numbers are declining, including some populations in Australia. Off Australia\u0026rsquo;s north-east coast of Queensland, tiger sharks are estimated to have fallen by at least 71%, largely due to overfishing and bycatch. A reduction in tiger sharks means more seagrass grazing by herbivores, which means less carbon is sequestered in sea vegetation. In the Caribbean and Indonesia where shark populations have dwindled, overgrazing by herbivores like sea turtles is already a profound threat to seagrass habitats, and has led to a 90 to 100% loss of seagrass.\nAs well as meaning less carbon is absorbed, the loss of seagrass also makes the habitat less able to recover from extreme, climate change-driven weather events, such as heatwaves.\nSHRINKING SHARK NUMBERS There is clear evidence that shark populations are declining the world over, and humans are largely to blame. A recent reassessment by the IUCN Red List found that 37.5% of all shark and ray species are now threatened with extinction. Catherine Macdonald, marine conservation biologist and a lecturer at the University of Miami, points out that oceanic sharks and rays have declined in abundance by 71% since 1970. Overfishing is their biggest threat, but loss of coastal habitats, prey loss and declines in water quality are also contributing factors.\nOne of Western Australia\u0026rsquo;s worst heatwaves hit in 2011, with ocean temperatures rising by 5C for two months. The heatwave was catastrophic for the bay\u0026rsquo;s dominant species of seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, which forms rich, dense meadows that hold sediments and provide food for grazers. More than 90% of the Amphibolis antarctica was lost, the largest loss known across the bay.\nThis loss of seagrass was, perversely, a treat for the bay\u0026rsquo;s sea cows, who love a smaller and harder-to-find type of tropical seagrass that was ordinarily shielded from access by the tall, dense Amphibolis antarctica. When tropical seagrass is more accessible, sea cows in their enthusiasm are known to forage for it in a destructive way known as \u0026ldquo;excavation foraging\u0026rdquo;, digging up the rhizomes of their preferred seagrass, and making it harder for dense Amphibolis antarctica beds to reform.\nIn Shark Bay, the tiger sharks were somewhat able to restore the balance by keeping sea cow numbers down, and not all the bay\u0026rsquo;s seagrass was lost. But it begged the question: What if sharks were absent from the bay – would the Amphibolis antarctica dominated ecosystem survive?\nTo find out, researchers led by Rob Nowicki of Florida International University, spent time in Eastern Australia, where shark numbers were lower and sea cows grazed largely undisturbed. There, divers went down and plucked the seagrass, simulating the sea cows\u0026rsquo; grazing when there are no predators to stop them – the enthusiastic, destructive excavation foraging. Sure enough, they observed a rapid loss in seagrass coverage, particularly of Amphibolis antarctica, and the ecosystem began to shift to a more tropical picture dominated by tropical seagrass.\n\u0026ldquo;We learned that when unchecked, dugong grazing can rapidly destroy wide areas of seagrass when they perform excavation foraging,\u0026rdquo; says Nowicki. These changes can be long-lasting. “When the seagrass recovers, the seagrass community looks different, with different species dominating than before.\u0026rdquo;\nThose findings underlined the role that sharks were playing in Shark Bay. \u0026ldquo;Without tiger sharks keeping the dugongs in check, the bay would likely convert to mostly tropical seagrasses,\u0026rdquo; says Nowicki.\nSea cows, or dugongs, can be destructive grazers, rooting out the seagrass species that help hold the ecosystem together (Credit: Getty Images) Sea cows, or dugongs, can be destructive grazers, rooting out the seagrass species that help hold the ecosystem together (Credit: Getty Images)\nIf shark populations continue to decline at the rate they are around the world (see Shrinking Shark Numbers), the resilience of carbon-rich ocean ecosystems to extreme climate events like heatwaves will likely be compromised, Nowicki\u0026rsquo;s team concluded.\nThat said, Becca Selden, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Wellesley College, says the consequences for Shark Bay may be more profound than most, due to its unique ecosystem. \u0026ldquo;The strong effect may have been enhanced by its comparatively simple food web in the seagrass ecosystem where predators limit grazing by a megaherbivore,\u0026rdquo; Seldon explains. In other words, other coastal habitats may not fare quite so badly as Shark Bay when under similar pressure.\nAs well as keeping sea cow numbers down and making seagrass ecosystems more resilient, tiger sharks also play another crucial role in maintaining the health of the habitat. They act as potent fertilisers when they poo, and when they perish in the meadows.\n\u0026ldquo;Long-lived vertebrates can act as carbon sinks when carbon consumed at the ocean surface is transferred to the deep ocean by faeces and/or dead carcasses falling to the ocean floor,\u0026rdquo; says Selden.\nThis phenomenon, known as carbon sinking, is most well-established in whales, but there is research showing the same benefits exist for sharks. (Read more about how whale death and poo can help sink carbon at sea.)\nOne study led by Jessica Williams at Imperial College London found that grey reef sharks, which are commonly found in shallow reef ecosystems, transfer nutrients such as nitrogen to their habitats via faecal matter. They estimated that the population of over 8,000 grey sharks in Palmyra Atoll provided around 94.5kg (210lb) of nitrogen a day.\nSince the tiger sharks in Shark Bay spend ample time hunting in and moving through the seagrass beds, it’s likely they provide similar fertilising benefits to those plants. \u0026ldquo;Large pelagic sharks may be the most important contributors to this effect, including blue sharks, makos and hammerheads,\u0026rdquo; says Selden.\nWith global numbers of sharks declining, the need to understand how they support their ecosystems becomes even more pressing (Credit: Getty Images) With global numbers of sharks declining, the need to understand how they support their ecosystems becomes even more pressing (Credit: Getty Images)\nWhen it comes to boosting shark numbers, conservationists are up against a formidable opponent: The fishing industry.\nAccording to Nowicki and Selden, there has been a movement towards more sustainable fishing, but a large percentage of the industry have not modified their methods, which is a prime reason why many marine apex predators continue to decline. The varying stringency of animal protection laws between different nations also plays a part.\n\u0026ldquo;Since many predatory fish are also wide-ranging, they can cover many nations\u0026rsquo; jurisdictions, some of which may not protect them or practice sustainable fishing practices,\u0026rdquo; says Nowicki.\nReducing illegal and unsustainable fishing has been an uphill battle, though consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious and choosing sustainable fisheries over unsustainable.\n\u0026ldquo;Sustainable, coordinated, ecosystem-based fisheries management is a major tool to conserve these predators and their ecological role. Everyday citizens can do this by getting informed, reading up on the science, demanding that fisheries become or remain sustainable, and making sustainable seafood purchases,\u0026rdquo; says Nowicki.\nIf you’re unsure which seafood is truly sustainable, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) assesses fisheries internationally, so if a distributor is certified sustainable, there will be a blue MSC seal on the package.\nAnd aside from supporting sustainable fishing, Nowicki says the only way to truly protect marine life is to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions. \u0026ldquo;Ultimately, if we are going to conserve our ecosystems in the centuries to come, we are going to need to solve climate change while undertaking species conservation at the same time.\u0026rdquo;\nEven if shark populations are restored to more abundant numbers, their contribution to carbon sinking and mitigation will be just one small part in the effort to curb climate change. But sharks\u0026rsquo; abundance has an undeniable ripple effect on the many marine ecosystems that rely on healthy, plentiful seagrass in one way or another. By leveling the ecological playing field, sharks are fortifying these ecosystems against the threat of climate change, so they can live to sink carbon another day.\n\u0026ndash;\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

        "body": "From a breeding laboratory putting species on \u0026ldquo;life support\u0026rdquo; to the world\u0026rsquo;s first fully electric smart tractor, California\u0026rsquo;s scientists and farmers are working to halt the rapid decline of the state\u0026rsquo;s butterflies.\nPatience and a steady hand. Hand-rearing butterfly larvae is much like raising children in that respect, explains Ester Chang, the senior wildlife care specialist at San Diego Zoo\u0026rsquo;s Wildlife Alliance.\n\u0026ldquo;They get kind of territorial,\u0026rdquo; Chang says. \u0026ldquo;If one caterpillar goes too close to the shelter of another, they stick their little heads down and headbutt each other.\u0026rdquo;\nBug-on-bug violence is an everyday concern at the Wildlife Alliance\u0026rsquo;s federally funded invertebrate conservation facility. Or caterpillar crèche, as some prefer it.\n\u0026ldquo;We ended up having to separate them into smaller groups,\u0026rdquo; says Chang. \u0026ldquo;The number of container cups just kept increasing and increasing. And they started eating more and more, so it took a lot of patience!\u0026rdquo;\nChang is one of the small team of specialists headed by Paige Howorth, curator of invertebrates at the facility, whose sole job it is to hold back the death-march of extinction for these creatures.\nThe butterflies are the canary in the coal mine – Scott Black Population declines of butterflies have been so dramatic in California recently that for some species, this fertility clinic is the only reason they still exist at all.\nThe Laguna Mountains skipper, for example – a one-inch-wide butterfly with dark brown and cream mottled wings – is found only in a small area of the Cleveland National Forest, around 30 miles away from the zoo. Or it used to be. A skipper hasn\u0026rsquo;t been seen on the mountain of its name for over 20 years.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s just one of 18 critically endangered Californian butterfly and moth species that risk being lost forever thanks to a combination of global warming, loss of habitat, pesticide poisoning, wildfires and drought.\nA Laguna Mountains skipper butterfly founder in its transport container, prior to being re-released in its habitat (Credit: Michael Ready) A Laguna Mountains skipper butterfly founder in its transport container, prior to being re-released in its habitat (Credit: Michael Ready)\nHoworth\u0026rsquo;s team has been forced to collect adult female skippers from the neighbouring Palomar mountain in the hope of breeding them in the lab, where they can be protected. Once these founder adults are secured they\u0026rsquo;re fed flowers and nectar-water by hand until they lay eggs. Either that or Gatorade.\n\u0026ldquo;We tried different solutions and the adults do seem to like Gatorade. For the larvae, they feed on the host plant where the adults lay their eggs,\u0026rdquo; Howorth says, of the Cleveland\u0026rsquo;s Horkelia leaves, a flowering perennial herb the team line in each of the larvae incubation cups.\nOn the underside of the plant\u0026rsquo;s paw-like leaves, seen with the help of a suspended magnifying glass, are tiny light-green dots: butterfly eggs.\n\u0026ldquo;We take a lot of care feeding them making sure they get sun exposure, you know, for egg development. We have a system where we move the adults to dishes that have plastic sponge filters to deliver the nectar solution. For adult butterflies… we give them a little spritz that kind of falls on them [like morning dew]. We usually only bring in 20 adults. So it\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing effort, every egg counts,\u0026rdquo; Howorth says.\nThe rearing of these insects is a labour-intensive process. If the eggs take well, tiny caterpillars soon emerge and grow for seven weeks before nestling in small, bamboo drinking straws to form a chrysalis. The resulting pupae are then taken to pre-designated areas of natural habitat where, with luck, they will begin a life in the wild.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a lot of effort for the delivery of what is usually just over 250 animals, especially given the two-week lifespan of most of the butterflies. But when the species is part of a collapsing population of pollinators in a state that accounts for over a third of America\u0026rsquo;s vegetable production and two-thirds of the country\u0026rsquo;s fruits and nuts, the urgency makes more sense.\nA late-stage Laguna Mountains Skipper caterpillar peers out from a protective silken screen of its own making. The larva will pupate inside this shelter (Credit: Michael Ready) A late-stage Laguna Mountains Skipper caterpillar peers out from a protective silken screen of its own making. The larva will pupate inside this shelter (Credit: Michael Ready)\nAccording to a US Fish and Wildlife Service report, it could cost more than $3m (£2.2m) and take until 2045 for the skipper to recover to the point where it\u0026rsquo;s no longer considered endangered.\nBut at least it\u0026rsquo;s a non-migratory butterfly whose local habitats are to monitor and whose populations are easier to sustain. The same can\u0026rsquo;t be said for California\u0026rsquo;s iconic monarch butterfly, which is unique in the way it journeys vast distances according to the seasons.\nMonarchs breed in Mexico, and many travel around 3,000 miles (4,800km) to overwinter along the Californian coast and in some areas of the Rocky Mountains. Today the migrations still continue, but the monarchs\u0026rsquo; population has seen a 99.9% crash in numbers since the 1980s, falling from around four million individuals to just 2,000 as of 2020.\n\u0026ldquo;The butterflies are the canary in the coal mine, you know,\u0026rdquo; says Scott Black, executive director of the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to see other butterflies and bees, and other important insects, and then our birds; and then our mammals head that same way if we don\u0026rsquo;t take action soon.\u0026rdquo;\nBlack equates the vibrancy of insects and plants to the health of the planet\u0026rsquo;s fabric. Rip up this fabric and the planet struggles to sustain bird, fish and animal life. And that of humans too.\n\u0026ldquo;Over 94% of songbirds need insects to feed their young,\u0026rdquo; says Black. \u0026ldquo;If you want to have fish in your rivers and streams then they need invertebrates to feed on. If you want to have pollination of your food crops, then think insects. I think that people really do need to wake up: the ramifications are clear and will affect humans on an everyday level in the next 20, 30 years. And that\u0026rsquo;s my kids, that\u0026rsquo;s everybody\u0026rsquo;s kids around the world.\u0026rdquo;\nMigratory western monarch butterflies overwinter in Santa Cruz in 2019. The following year their population dropped to less than 2,000 individuals (Credit: Michael Ready) Migratory western monarch butterflies overwinter in Santa Cruz in 2019. The following year their population dropped to less than 2,000 individuals (Credit: Michael Ready)\nBlack points to projects like those run by Howorth as key for sustaining species on \u0026ldquo;life support\u0026rdquo;. But Xerces also supports projects working to stave off the need for such hands-on rescue.\nOne such project is the Monarch Challenge, brainchild of Carlo Mondavi – grandson of the renowned winemaker Robert Mondavi – whose mission has been to reduce the harmful impact of vineyards and agriculture on butterfly biodiversity in California\u0026rsquo;s northern Napa Valley and Sonoma areas.\nMondavi has created a system of wine making that shows it\u0026rsquo;s possible to farm sustainably and with minimal carbon footprint while adding only 18 cents (13p) to the price of each bottle produced, a model that he says could be adopted by other vineyards.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know any of my farmer friends that wakes up in the morning and says, \u0026lsquo;I want to go spray chemicals.\u0026rsquo; Not one of them. They\u0026rsquo;re terrible for the soil microbiome and the farm algae. And no-one likes working the land in hazmat suits. They all hate it,\u0026rdquo; Mondavi says.\nNo herbicides are used at his Raen winery, instead Mondavi relies on \u0026ldquo;good bugs and good weeds taking care of the bad ones\u0026rdquo;, to encourage biodiversity.\nOn top of committing 100% of profits of their pinot noir rosé to growing conservation awareness, the winery also provides packets of milkweed seeds – the natural host-plant habitat for monarch butterflies – with every bottle sold, in the hope this will help repopulate butterfly overwintering sites across America.\nBut Mondavi\u0026rsquo;s most exciting product, inspired by the quest to save butterflies, according to the entrepreneurial vintner, is the all-electric Monarch Tractor he\u0026rsquo;s helped develop with co-founder and chief executive, Praveen Penmetsa.\n\u0026ldquo;Farming is the most important job on our planet. And that means the most important tool right now on the planet is a tractor,\u0026rdquo; says Penmetsa, of the vehicle they claim is the world\u0026rsquo;s first fully electric smart tractor. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s used in 80% of farm operations yet tractor technology is fundamentally the same as it was a century ago.\u0026rdquo;\nPrimarily, that has meant big diesel engines, with corresponding emissions of carbon and air pollutants. While the electric tractor lowers emissions on the farm, Penmetsa hopes the information it provides can help improve sustainability much further. \u0026ldquo;The data from our tractor platform and AI means a farmer can provide some traceability, data that starts a behaviour change, as well as not using fossil fuels.\u0026rdquo;\nThe tractor sells for $58,000 (£43,000), which the makers suggest will be earned back in savings in a matter of years. As well as delivering haulage, the Monarch Tractor has digital cameras as well as temperature, wind speed and weight sensors, all feeding data into a computer that uses machine learning to help the farmer track the productivity of their land.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s unreasonable for us to expect our farmers to solve the problem [of environmental damage], without giving them the tools to do so and a way to make it profitable,\u0026rdquo; Penmetsa adds.\nFor Mondavi, the lightbulb moment came with the widespread fires that hit the Napa Valley region in the last few years. \u0026ldquo;When the wildfires surrounded my family\u0026rsquo;s farm in 2017, and burned a lot of my very good friends\u0026rsquo; homes and communities I realised: \u0026lsquo;Holy smokes, unless we address climate change, what are we fighting for?\u0026rsquo; And so the really incredible thing about the tractor is it\u0026rsquo;s a bridge away from our dependence on fossil fuel.\u0026rdquo;\nFarmers hope that smart technology can help reduce the use of herbicides that threaten butterfly populations (Credit: Monarch Tractor) Farmers hope that smart technology can help reduce the use of herbicides that threaten butterfly populations (Credit: Monarch Tractor)\nMondavi argues the amount of carbon prevented from entering the atmosphere from farms each year can be measured in tonnes, and the use of an electric tractor adds significant numbers to the savings.\n\u0026ldquo;If you plug into the grid [rather than use diesel], your average farmer saves 53 tonnes of carbon per tractor per year. It\u0026rsquo;s another 25 metric tonnes when you\u0026rsquo;re going solar or completely renewable for your farm\u0026rsquo;s power supply, and those are based on our recent, modest calculations.\u0026rdquo;\nPenmetsa says he has been receiving enquiries about the tractor from around the world. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve had farmers from New Zealand, all the way up to Norway, and from Japan, you know, to our neighbouring states here in America reach out to us. Against the cost they all see the value of both the [sustainability], automation and data collection capabilities.\u0026rdquo;\nFor Black, a man who first became intrigued with insects when hunting fireflies in his Omaha backyard as a child, there are other ways in which technology is helping the plight of butterflies on the west coast.\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service has a citizen scientist scheme, which they hope will raise awareness. Xerces itself runs and hosts the Monarch Milkweed Mapper, a platform that uses crowd sourcing to help with their conservation efforts. Members can report butterfly sightings, breeding areas and the presence of milkweed habitats to a platform that helps to capture the insect health of a vast area of the United States in real time. As well as engaging local communities in the conservation effort, the platform also helps build a database of images and metadata on hard-to-track populations.\nXerces is also campaigning for legislators to pass a bill that would allow millions of dollars to be allocated to conservation projects across the west of America.\nBut for Black, the largest impact could be made by the general public of the state he calls home. He advises three simple things that residents not just in California but around the world could do to help in the fight to save the butterflies.\n\u0026ldquo;Whether you have a tiny yard, or you manage a giant national forest, butterflies all need the same things: food to eat. They need flowers that they can [access for] nectar, and they need their host plants to lay their eggs. So look to plant and grow native flowers,\u0026rdquo; Black says.\n\u0026ldquo;Number two, they need refuge from pesticides. And pesticides are used more per acre in urban areas than in rural areas. So be mindful about the chemicals you\u0026rsquo;re using for your pristine lawn or to kill mosquitoes in the back yard.\n\u0026ldquo;And the third thing would be to return to a little bit of messiness. Humans seem to love the idea of \u0026lsquo;golf course landscapes\u0026rsquo;. Even farms are so regimented and structured, one crop over vast areas. But nature is kind of messy, and butterflies, when they pupate, find some secluded place maybe under brambles, or under a pile of sticks or in an old rock wall. So, messiness can provide refuge and would go a long way to help these insects survive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash;\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

        "title": "The ancient Persian way to keep cool",
        "body": "From ancient Egypt to the Persian Empire, an ingenious method of catching the breeze kept people cool for millennia. In the search for emissions-free cooling, the \u0026ldquo;wind catcher\u0026rdquo; could once again come to our aid. Bangladesh.\nThe city of Yazd in the desert of central Iran has long been a focal point for creative ingenuity. Yazd is home to a system of ancient engineering marvels that include an underground refrigeration structure called yakhchāl, an underground irrigation system called qanats, and even a network of couriers called pirradaziš that predate postal services in the US by more than 2,000 years.\nAmong Yazd\u0026rsquo;s ancient technologies is the wind catcher, or bâdgir in Persian. These remarkable structures are a common sight soaring above the rooftops of Yazd. They are often rectangular towers, but they also appear in circular, square, octagonal and other ornate shapes.\nYazd is said to have the most wind catchers in the world, though they may have originated in ancient Egypt. In Yazd, the wind catcher soon proved indispensable, making this part of the hot and arid Iranian Plateau livable.\nThough many of the city\u0026rsquo;s wind catchers have fallen out of use, the structures are now drawing academics, architects and engineers back to the desert city to see what role they could play in keeping us cool in a rapidly heating world.\nThe openings of the towers face the prevailing wind, catching it and funneling it down to the interior below (Credit: Alamy) The openings of the towers face the prevailing wind, catching it and funneling it down to the interior below (Credit: Alamy)\nAs a wind catcher requires no electricity to power it, it is both a cost-efficient and green form of cooling. With conventional mechanical air conditioning already accounting for a fifth of total electricity consumption globally, ancient alternatives like the wind catcher are becoming an increasingly appealing option.\nThere are two main forces that drive the air through and down into the structures: the incoming wind and the change in buoyancy of air depending on temperature – with warmer air tending to rise above cooler, denser air. First, as air is caught by the opening of a wind catcher, it is funneled down to the dwelling below, depositing any sand or debris at the foot of the tower. Then the air flows throughout the interior of the building, sometimes over subterranean pools of water for further cooling. Eventually, warmed air will rise and leave the building through another tower or opening, aided by the pressure within the building.\nThe shape of the tower, alongside factors like the layout of the house, the direction the tower is facing, how many openings it has, its configuration of fixed internal blades, canals and height are all finely tuned to improve the tower\u0026rsquo;s ability to draw wind down into the dwellings below.\nSome of the earliest wind-catching technology comes from Egypt 3,300 years ago Using the wind to cool buildings has a history stretching back almost as long as people have lived in hot desert environments. Some of the earliest wind-catching technology comes from Egypt 3,300 years ago, according to researchers Chris Soelberg and Julie Rich of Weber State University in Utah. Here, buildings had thick walls, few windows facing the Sun, openings to take in air on the side of prevailing winds and an exit vent on the other side – known in Arabic as malqaf architecture. Though some argue that the birthplace of the wind catcher was Iran itself.\nWherever it was first invented, wind catchers have since become widespread across the Middle East and North Africa. Variations of Iran\u0026rsquo;s wind catchers can be found in the barjeels of Qatar and Bahrain, the malqaf of Egypt, the mungh of Pakistan, and many other places, notes Fatemeh Jomehzadeh of the University of Technology Malaysia and colleagues.\nDue to long disuse, many of Iran\u0026rsquo;s windcatchers are not in a good state of repair. But some researchers would like to see them restored to working order (Credit: Alamy) Due to long disuse, many of Iran\u0026rsquo;s windcatchers are not in a good state of repair. But some researchers would like to see them restored to working order (Credit: Alamy)\nThe Persian civilisation is widely considered to have added structural variations to allow for better cooling – such as combining it with its existing irrigation system to help to cool the air down before releasing it throughout the home. In Yazd\u0026rsquo;s hot, dry climate, these structures proved remarkably popular, until the city became a hotspot of soaring ornate towers seeking the desert wind. The historical city of Yazd was recognised as a Unesco World Heritage site in 2017, in part for its proliferation of wind catchers.\nAs well as performing the functional purpose of cooling homes, the towers also had a strong cultural significance. In Yazd, the wind catchers are as much a part of the skyline as the Zoroastrian Fire Temple and Tower of Silence. Among them is the wind catcher at the Dowlatabad Abad Gardens, said to be the tallest in the world at 33m (108ft) and one of the few wind catchers still in operation. Housed in an octagonal building, it overlooks a fountain stretching past rows of pine trees.\nInconveniences like pests entering the chutes and the gathering of dust and desert debris have meant many have turned away from traditional wind catchers The emissions-free cooling efficacy of such wind catchers make some researchers argue that they are due a revival.\nParham Kheirkhah Sangdeh has extensively studied the scientific application and surrounding culture of wind catchers in contemporary architecture at Ilam University in Iran. He says inconveniences like pests entering the chutes and the gathering of dust and desert debris have meant many have turned away from traditional wind catchers. In their place are mechanical cooling systems, such as conventional air-conditioning units. Often, those options are powered by fossil fuels and use refrigerants that act as powerful greenhouse gases if released into the atmosphere.\nThe wind catchers of Iran have inspired modern designs in Europe, the US and elsewhere, as architects turn towards passive forms of cooling (Credit: Alamy) The wind catchers of Iran have inspired modern designs in Europe, the US and elsewhere, as architects turn towards passive forms of cooling (Credit: Alamy)\nThe advent of modern cooling technologies has long been blamed for the deterioration of traditional methods in Iran, the historian of Iranian architecture Elizabeth Beazley wrote in 1977. Without constant maintenance, the harsh climate of the Iranian Plateau has worn away many structures from wind catchers to ice houses. Kheirkhah Sangdeh also sees the shift away from wind catchers as in part down to a tendency among the public to engage with technologies from the West.\n\u0026ldquo;There needs to be some changes in cultural perspectives to use these technologies. People need to keep an eye on the past and understand why energy conservation is important,\u0026rdquo; Kheirkhah Sangdeh says. \u0026ldquo;It starts with recognising cultural history and the importance of energy conservation.\u0026rdquo;\nKheirkhah Sangdeh hopes to see Iran\u0026rsquo;s wind catchers updated to add energy-efficient cooling to existing buildings. But he has met many barriers to his work in the form of ongoing international tensions, the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing water shortage. \u0026ldquo;Things are so bad in Iran that [people] take it day by day,\u0026rdquo; says Kheirkhah Sangdeh.\nYazd is said to have the most wind catchers of any city in the world (Credit: Alamy) Yazd is said to have the most wind catchers of any city in the world (Credit: Alamy)\nFossil-fuel-free methods of cooling like the wind catcher might well be due a revival, but to a surprising extent they are already present – albeit in a less magnificent form than those in Iran – in many Western countries.\nIn the UK, some 7,000 variations of wind catchers were installed in public buildings between 1979 and 1994. They can be seen from buildings such as the Royal Chelsea Hospital in London, to supermarkets in Manchester.\nThese modernised wind catchers bear little resemblance to Iran\u0026rsquo;s towering structures. On one three-storey building on a busy road in north London, small hot pink ventilation towers allow passive ventilation. Atop a shopping centre in Dartford, conical ventilation towers rotate to catch the breeze with the help of a rear wing that keeps the tower facing the prevailing wind.\nThe US too has adopted wind-catcher-inspired designs with enthusiasm. One such example is the visitor center at Zion National Park in southern Utah. The park sits in a high desert plateau, comparable to Yazd in climate and topography, and the use of passive cooling technologies including the wind catcher nearly eliminated the need for mechanical air-conditioning. Scientists have recorded a temperature difference of 16C (29F) between the outside and inside of the visitor centre, despite the many bodies regularly passing through.\nThere is further scope for the spread of the wind catcher, as the search for sustainable solutions to overheating continues. In Palermo, Sicily, researchers have found that the climate and prevailing wind conditions make it a ripe location for a version of the Iranian wind catcher. This October, meanwhile, the wind catcher is set to have a high-profile position at the World Expo fair in Dubai, as part of a network of conical buildings in the Austrian pavilion, where the Austrian architecture firm Querkraft has taken inspiration from the Arabic barjeel version of the wind tower.\nWhile researchers such as Kheirkhah Sangdeh argue that the wind catcher has much more to give in cooling homes without fossil fuels, this ingenious technology has already migrated further around the world than you might think. Next time you see a tall vented tower on top of a supermarket, high-rise or school, look carefully – you might just be looking at the legacy of the magnificent wind catchers of Iran.\n--\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

The island, off the coast of southern Bangladesh, was rapidly eroding into the sea, causing both land and life to retreat. Many packed up and moved. Those who couldn\u0026rsquo;t, stayed – inching back, as the island they had called home for generations changed around them. \u0026ldquo;These were families I had gotten to know, trust and respect,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;It regularly moved me to tears.\u0026rdquo;\nChowdhury was witnessing Bangladesh\u0026rsquo;s climate migration, caused by sea level rise linked to climate change. By 2050, up to 13.3 million Bangladeshis may become displaced due to climate change.\nYet, just off Kutubdia Island\u0026rsquo;s shore, a glimmer of hope is visible amid the waves. Jutting out of the water, oyster-encrusted reefs glisten in the sun. These reefs are vibrant homes for marine life, a potential source of income for local people and, Chowdhury hopes, they could become a formidable force to defend Kutubdia Island from sea level rise.\n"

        "title": "The Ingenious Living Bridges India",
        "body": "For centuries, indigenous groups in north-east India have crafted intricate bridges from living fig trees. Now this ancient skill is making its way to European cities.\nWhen monsoon clouds bring pelting rains to the village of Tyrna, Shailinda Syiemlieh takes the nearest bridge to reach the opposite bank of a gushing stream. The bridge is no ordinary structure made of concrete and metal. Instead, it is composed of a single giant fig tree that sits by the riverbank, and the support that Syiemlieh walks over is a mishmash of aerial roots tightly knotted and woven together. The bridge is not only a part of the landscape, it is helping to support its ecosystem at the same time.\nTyrna lies just above the plains of Bangladesh in the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya, which hosts hundreds of these bridges. For centuries, they have helped the indigenous Khasi and Jaintia communities to cross swelling rivers in monsoons. \u0026ldquo;Our ancestors were so clever,\u0026rdquo; says Syiemlieh, \u0026ldquo;When they couldn\u0026rsquo;t cross rivers, they made Jingkieng Jri – the living root bridges.\u0026rdquo;\nMeghalaya hosts some of the wettest locations on Earth. The village Mawsynram, the world\u0026rsquo;s rainiest place, receives an annual rainfall of 11,871mm (39ft) – that would be enough to submerge a typical three-storey house if deluged all at once. Nearby Sohra comes second, averaging 11,430mm (37.5ft). From June to September, monsoon winds sweep north from the Bay of Bengal, passing over the humid plains of Bangladesh. When these air currents meet the hilly terrain of Meghalaya, they break open – and torrential rains begin.\nWhen monsoon downpours periodically isolated the remote villages of Syiemlieh\u0026rsquo;s ancestors from nearby towns, they trained living aerial roots of Indian rubber fig tree (Ficus elastica) to form a bridge across flooding rivers.\nResearchers consider these living root bridges as an example of indigenous climate resilience. Aside from the connectivity they provide, these bridges attract tourists and help local people earn an income. Meanwhile, as researchers have found, they have regenerative effects on the surrounding environment. Scientists hope this concept of indigenous living architecture can help modern cities adapt better to climate change.\nBuilding these bridges takes decades of work. It begins with planting a sapling of Ficus elastica – a tree that grows abundantly in the subtropical terrain of Meghalaya – in a good crossing place along the riverbank. First the trees develop large buttressing roots and then, after about a decade, the maturing trees sprout secondary aerial roots from further up. These aerial roots have a degree of elasticity, and tend to join and grow together to form stable structures.\nIn a method perfected over centuries, the Khasi bridge builders weave aerial roots onto a bamboo or another wooden scaffolding, wheedle them across the river and finally implant them on the opposite bank. Over time, the roots shorten, thicken and produce offshoots called daughter roots, which are also trained over the river. The builders intertwine these roots with one another or with branches and trunks of the same or another fig tree. They merge by a process called anastomosis – where branching systems like leaf vessels, tendrils and aerial roots naturally fuse together – and weave into a dense frame-like structure. Sometimes, the Khasi builders use stones to cover the gaps in root structures. This network of roots matures over time to bear loads; some bridges can hold up to 50 people at once.\nThe generations that follow the initial bridge builders continue the maintenance of the bridge. While only one single person may maintain small bridges, most require the collective effort of families or the entire village – sometimes several villages. This process of care and development down the generations can last for centuries, with some bridges dating from 600 years ago.\nAs well as being a regenerative form of architecture, living root bridges grow stronger with time, self-repairing and becoming more robust as they age. \u0026ldquo;When it rains heavily, small cement bridges wash away and steel bridges tend to rust, but living root bridges withstand the rains,\u0026rdquo; says Syiemlieh.\n\u0026ldquo;People came to realise that root bridges are much more durable than modern alternatives, and they cost absolutely nothing. So villagers now repair root bridges they had abandoned in the forest valleys.\u0026rdquo;\nThis resurgence in interest in root bridges is in part thanks to the efforts of Morningstar Khongthaw, a native from Rangthylliang village, who founded the Living Bridge Foundation. Khongthaw and his team create awareness about root bridges, repair and maintain old bridges while also constructing new ones.\nUnlike conventional bridges, root bridges are also central to their surroundings. Apart from producing their own building material, the trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide over their lifetimes. They help stabilise the soil and prevent landslides. Conventional bridges can disrupt the soil layers, but roots can anchor different soil structures which helps protect against soil erosion, says Ferdinand Ludwig, professor for green technologies in landscape architecture at the Technical University of Munich, who has been studying the bridges for 13 years.\nThis is true of many trees, but Ficus elastica plays a particularly important role in its ecosystem, says Salvador Lyngdoh, a local to Meghalaya and a scientist at the Biodiversity Institute of India, whose work focuses on conservation in the Himalayas. Fig trees are framework species that promote biodiversity around them: moss grows on them, squirrels live in their branches, birds nest within their canopy, and they support insects that help with pollination. The act of turning these trees into bridges can also help animals to thrive in their habitat, says Lyngdoh. Bark deer and clouded leopards are known to use root bridges to move from one part of the forest to another.\nRoot bridges may not be able to outperform the conventional kind in every sense, Lyngdoh notes. A conventional bridge can bear more weight, for example. \u0026ldquo;But root bridges are much more useful to a large sphere of natural species than the modern bridges we have,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;The living root bridge is a mosaic that\u0026rsquo;s embedded within the forest. Species do not differentiate between the bridge and natural forest.\u0026rdquo;\nThis form of indigenous architecture has fascinated scientists like the Technical University of Munich\u0026rsquo;s Ludwig, for the potential to learn from them to make buildings and spaces in other parts of the world greener.\nLudwig sees these bridges as an example of not just sustainable development, which minimises the damage and degradation of natural systems, but of regenerative development. The latter attempts to reverse degradation and improve the health of the ecosystem. But understanding the living root bridges is not an easy process.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no one way to build these bridges,\u0026rdquo; says Ludwig. \u0026ldquo;How these roots are pulled, tied and woven together differ from builder to builder. None of the bridges looks similar.\u0026rdquo;\nThe lack of historical written information on the bridges has also been a challenge in researching them. Until the British colonial period in the 19th Century, native Khasi inhabitants in Meghalaya didn\u0026rsquo;t have a written script, as the Khasi way of life is passed down through oral histories. This has meant that documented information on the bridges is sparse.\n"

        "title": "How Morocco went big on solar energy",
        "body": "Morocco has become famous for its vast, world-leading solar arrays. But these mega-projects are just the start of the action on climate change that Morocco could be capable of delivering.\nMorocco has made a name for itself as a climate leader. Renewables make up almost two-fifths of its electricity capacity, some fossil fuel subsidies have been phased out and the country lays claim to some of the world\u0026rsquo;s largest clean energy projects. The country has received much praise for its actions to decarbonise.\nThe country\u0026rsquo;s reputation may be well deserved, but it still faces real challenges – its geographical position in a warming hotspot makes it vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. And even as it seeks to end its dependence on fossil fuels, its energy demands are rising fast.\nDespite these challenges, Morocco has a huge natural potential to produce solar, wind and hydropower, and has taken significant steps to realise it. Morocco\u0026rsquo;s national action on climate change dates back to the mid-2000s, when the country made the decision to become a regional leader in clean energy and to push forward massive renewables projects. The country\u0026rsquo;s leaders bet on these major transformations as a way to be economically competitive in the future, as well as to reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports and ensure security of energy supply, says Mohamed Alaoui, the managing director of Africa Climate Solutions, a consultancy firm based in Casablanca.\nShining bright\nIn 2009, Morocco set out an ambitious energy plan which aimed for 42% of total installed power capacity to be renewable energy by 2020. The plan drove a strong expansion of both wind and solar over the following decade, with solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity increasing 16-fold (albeit from a low base) and wind six-fold by 2020. Morocco also built the Noor-Ouarzazate complex, the world\u0026rsquo;s largest concentrated solar power plant, an enormous array of curved mirrors spread over 3,000 hectares (11.6 sq miles) which concentrate the Sun\u0026rsquo;s rays towards tubes of fluid, with the hot liquid then used to produce power.\nUltimately, Morocco missed its 2020 target, with renewables at 37% of capacity in 2020. But the country has come a long way. Morocco has since pledged to increase the renewables in its electricity mix to 52% by 2030, made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydro. Compared with many other countries, Morocco is doing relatively well on climate action, with its policies and pledges close to being in line with limiting global temperatures to 1.5C, according to analysis from the research group Climate Action Tracker. The country also underwent constitutional reform in 2011 to address gender inequality, known to be a powerful tool in tackling climate change as well as social injustice.\nIn June 2021, Morocco updated its UN climate pledge with a promise to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 17-18% by 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario, with a stretch target of a 42-46% cut on the condition of receiving international support. It has also made a significant effort to decrease government support for fossil fuels, taking advantage of low oil prices in 2014-15 to successfully phase out petrol and fuel oil subsidies.\nThe country has been praised for using money saved from fossil fuel subsidies to increase funds for education and to implement a health insurance scheme. However, financial support for oil products is still around $3.4bn (£2.5bn), about two-thirds of Morocco\u0026rsquo;s annual budget deficit.\nWhile Morocco\u0026rsquo;s emissions are small compared with many more developed nations, burning fossil fuels for energy and cement production are still a big source of emissions in the country. Morocco still imports most of its energy to meet its rising energy consumption, which increased at an average annual rate of 6.5% between 2002 and 2015. Much of that imported energy is generated from fossil fuels. Morocco relies particularly heavily on coal power, which it is expanding along with renewables, and around 40% of electricity in the country comes from coal. However, at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this month, Morocco was among the 20 countries who made a new commitment to building no new coal power plants.\n"
